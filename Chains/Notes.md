### Chains

- It allows us to connect multiple steps (like prompts, LLMs, tools, etc.) together â€” this is called a Chain.

### Why Chains?

- Chains help you:

    1. Break a big task into small parts.

    2. Control what happens step by step.

    3. Combine tools (like prompts + LLM + memory).

### Types of Chains in LangChain

- Simple Chain
- Sequential Chain
- Parallel Chain
- Condinational Chain

**1. Simple chain**
- Simple chain means it is goes linear way like this 
    prompt -> model -> parser

**2. Sequential Chain**
- Sequential chains means You want multiple inputs and outputs in steps.
    User input -> Report(Give LLM) -> Print -> One more(LLM Call for Extract 5 main points from report) -> Print -> End
    chain = prompt1 | model | parser | prompt2 | model | parser
